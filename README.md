# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is done as follows: 
   - Inspect data
   - Merge data sets
   - Perform calculations
   - Create data series and dataframes.
   
 Using the software environment Jupyter Notebook and Pandas and applying two-dimensional plotting library Matplotlib, assist us to produce publication quality figures
 and tell a visual story from the data which means to present complex findings in a way that is informative and engaging to all the stackholders. 
 
 In fact, the specific purpose of this analysis to create a summary dataframe of the ride-sharing data by city type and then using pandas and Matplotlib to create 
 a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
   
  

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: [Anaconda( Jupyter Notebook )](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), [Matplotlib-Python Plotting](https://matplotlib.org/) 
- Module: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot

## Results
Looking at the ride-sharing dataframe, we can see:

   - The total rides in the urban cities is about 2.6- and 13-times more per city than the suburban and rural cities, respectively.
   - The total drivers in the urban cities is about 5- and 31-times more per city than the suburban and rural cities, respectively. This shows that driving jobs
   in the urban cities is more prosperous.
   - The total fares in the urban cities is about 39854 which is not much different from the total fares in the suburban cities, almost 2.1-times and it is still
   9.2-times more per city than the rural cities.
   - The amount of average fare per ride in the rural and suburban cities is very close while the average fare per ride in the urban cities is less than the 
   amount of average fare per ride in the recent cities.
   - The average fare per driver in the rural and suburban cities is about 3.3- and 2.4-times more than the average fare per driver in the urban cities, repectively.
The above results show that total rides, drivers and fares in the urban cities are more than the other cities while the average fare per ride and driver in the rural 
cities are more than the suburban and urban cities. In other words, suburban cities are mediated by all the five parameters.


   
   
 
   

## Summary
After replacing the values of reading and math scores with "NaN"s, the values of the "School Type", "Total Students", "Total School Budget" and "Per Student Budget"
have not changed, and have been influential in associated with math and reading scores
- " Average Math Score" has moved to 83.350937
- " Average Reading Score " has moved to 83.896082 
- " % Passing Math " has moved to 93.185690
- " % Passing reading " has moved to 97.018739
- " % Overall Passing " has moved to 90.630324
